					<h2>About Me</h2>
				</header>
				<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images\IMG_E4806.JPG" alt="" /></a>
				<p>Hola! My name is Rafael Alvarez and I'll be King of the Pir... Programmers! I've been a diving coach for the past eight year. Trained divers from beginner to international level success. I've been extremely grateful and blessed as a coach during my time with Indiana International School of Diving. I've qualified divers to the Indiana high school state meet (2nd place best finish), multiple County and Conference champions, USA Diving National Championships (7th place best finish, 2019 national runner-up as a team woot woot!), and international meets.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Around the begginning of 2019, I began wanting a in my life. I loved coaching but wanted more for myself as far as a career. I began looking up options for myself until I stumpled across Eleven Fifty Academy. I was immediately interested and wanted to know more about coding. I went to a free class the first weekend in May and was instantly hooked! I had two weeks to set up registration for their next Python course, get a laptop, and I succeeded! I quit my day job so I could attend the classes from 9-5, Monday-Friday. I still coached in the evenings, especially since national qualifiers were underway. It was a busy 3 months, but I loved every second of it.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I graduated from Eleven Fifty's Python course on August 9th. Now i was eager to begin my job hunt for my new career, but something else felt off. I'd been wanting to move out of Indianapolis for some time now but never felt that the time was right. I knew I wanted a change in scenery as the Midwest was not my ideal spot. It's humid and flat and I was not a fan of any of it! I always saw myself in a city with actual seasons, not humid, and a beatiful surroudnings. My best friend from high school moved here seven years and I've always been fascinated with Salt Lake City. After some thinking and realzing that I graduated from Elevn Fifty in August, my rent lease ended at the end of August, and USA Diving calendar ended in August too, I thought there was no better time to move than now! Like before, I had about two, three weeks to setup and finalize the move and on September 7th, I arrived and succesfully moved to SLC.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I immediately found a job at the Ramen Bar in downtown SLC. I've loved every second here in SLC so far. During these first three months, I've enjoyed eploring the city and mountains with my dog and best friend Sir Puppy Bark Bark, or Bark Bark for short. I've been able to practice and code during those three months. Now I'm ready to begin searching for a new career with my coding skills. Just an excited and eager junior developer looking for an opportunity!
